# Internacional, an abandoned WordPress plugin

Way, way back in 2010, Automattic employee [Alex Mills](https://github.com/Viper007Bond) attempted to write a WordPress plugin that added support for having content (posts) in multiple languages on a single WordPress site using no custom database tables. This is that attempt.

It was ultimately abandoned and sat dormant for nearly 5 years in an internal SVN repository.

Rather than letting it continue to collect dust for eternity, we've thrown it here on GitHub in the hope that it might provide inspiration or other usefulness to someone, somewhere.

**It is not intended to be used on a production site. Bugs will not be fixed. Development on it is dead.** It's in an unfinished state and we have no plans to ever finish it. As such, we will not be accepting pull requests.

You are however more than welcome to take this code and do whatever you want with it. Read it, fork it, copy parts of it into your own projects. It's up to you.

*This code is released under the same license as WordPress, GPLv2.*
